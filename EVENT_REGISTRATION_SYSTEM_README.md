# Event Registration System

## Overview

The Event Registration System is a comprehensive solution for managing event registrations in the SPANDAN 2025 Comic Chronicles platform. It allows approved users to register groups for individual events with validation, capacity management, and payment tracking.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ« **Event Registration Flow**
- **4-Step Process**: Event Selection â†’ Registration Details â†’ Payment â†’ Review & Submit
- **User Validation**: Only approved tier/pass registration holders can participate

- **Single Event Focus**: Each registration is for one specific event

### ðŸ‘¥ **User Management**
- **Approved User Validation**: All participants must have approved tier/pass registrations
- **Contact Person System**: One approved user acts as the group contact
- **Auto-fill Information**: User details populated from existing registrations

### ðŸ’° **Payment Integration**
- **Transaction Tracking**: Payment transaction ID required
- **Screenshot Upload**: Optional payment proof upload
- **Amount Calculation**: Event price Ã— number of participants
- **No Group Discounts**: Simple per-person pricing

### ðŸ“Š **Admin Management**
- **Registration Review**: Approve, reject, or delete registrations
- **Detailed Views**: Complete registration and member information
- **Status Tracking**: Pending, approved, rejected states
- **Export Functionality**: CSV export for reporting
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Registration counts and revenue tracking

### ðŸ”’ **Security & Validation**
- **Capacity Management**: Event participant limits enforced
- **User Verification**: Database-level validation against approved registrations
- **Row Level Security**: Secure data access policies
- **Audit Trail**: Review tracking with timestamps and reviewer information

## System Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
```sql
-- Event Registrations (Group Level)
event_registrations
â”œâ”€â”€ group_id (EVT-XXXXXXXX format)
â”œâ”€â”€ event_id (foreign key)
â”œâ”€â”€ contact information
â”œâ”€â”€ payment details
â””â”€â”€ status tracking

-- Event Registration Members (Individual Level)
event_registration_members
â”œâ”€â”€ user_id (validated against approved registrations)
â”œâ”€â”€ personal information
â”œâ”€â”€ group membership
â””â”€â”€ original registration reference
```

#### Validation Functions
- `validate_approved_user_id()` - Ensures user is in approved tier/pass registrations
- `get_approved_user_details()` - Retrieves user information for auto-fill
- `check_event_capacity()` - Validates event capacity before registration
- `generate_event_group_id()` - Creates unique group identifiers

### Frontend Components

#### User-Facing Pages
- **`/events/register`** - Main registration interface with step-by-step flow
- **Navigation Integration** - Accessible from main navigation menu

#### Admin Interface
- **`/admin/event-registrations`** - Complete admin management interface
- **Dashboard Integration** - Links from main admin dashboard

### Service Layer
- **`eventRegistrationService.ts`** - Complete CRUD operations for event registrations
- **Integration** - Works with existing event and user services
