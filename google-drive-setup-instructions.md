## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access denied" or "File not found"
**Solution**: Make sure your files are set to "Anyone with the link can view"

### Issue: Download doesn't start
**Solution**: Check that you copied the file ID correctly (no extra characters)

### Issue: Video doesn't play
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure video is in MP4 format
2. Check file size (very large files may take time to load)
3. Try a smaller/compressed video file

### Issue: Slow loading
**Solution**: 
- Use compressed files when possible
- Google Drive may throttle very large files

## üöÄ Advanced Tips

### For Better Video Performance:
1. **Compress your video** before uploading (aim for 50-100MB)
2. **Use MP4 format** with H.264 codec for best compatibility
3. **Resolution**: 1080p is usually sufficient for web playback

### For PDFs:
1. **Optimize PDF size** before uploading
2. **Use descriptive filenames** for better user experience

### File Organization:
1. Create a **"Spandan 2025"** folder in Google Drive
2. Upload all files there for easy management
3. Consider creating subfolders: "Brochures", "Videos", etc.
